  abstract = {Computer programs based on the exact calculations of the gravity and
	magnetic anomalies of polygonal prisms are faster in operation and
	more accurate than previous programs based on the numerical integration
	of polygonal laminas. The prism programs also are of more general
	application than existing computer programs that are based on the
	exact gravity and magnetic effects of rectangular prisms. There are
	no restrictions on the use of the exact formula for the gravitational
	attraction of a polygonal prism, but the formulas for the magnetic
	effect are restricted in that demagnetization is not considered,
	and a finite answer is not obtained in the unrealistic circumstance
	where an observation point coincides with an edge of the prism.Least-squares
	methods permit calculation of the gravity or magnetic effect of models
	without knowledge of the density or magnetization contrasts, respectively,
	by comparison of the observed anomalies with theoretical dimensionless
	values to determine contrasts as regression coefficients. The coefficient
	of correlation provides a goodness of fit estimate that helps model
	evaluation. After calculating a magnetic terrain correction for an
	outcrop of Quaternary dacite and andestite near Clear Lake, Calif.,
	an improvement of the coefficient of correlation from 88 to the 92
	percent level indicates that this volcanic unit probably extends
	at least 150 m beneath the surface. Application of a magnetic terrain
	correction to disconnected outcrops of Tertiary andesite, eliminates
	most of a prominent v-shaped magnetic anomaly south of the San Juan
	Mountains, Colo.},
